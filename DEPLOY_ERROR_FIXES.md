## Testing

### Test Page Enhancements

The `TestCloudWatch.vue` page has been enhanced with new test buttons:

1. **Deploy Error Simulation**:
   - Test Payment Timeout (5000ms)
   - Test Connection Pool Exhaustion
   - Test HTTPS Connection Timeout
   - Simulate All Deploy Errors

2. **Service Health Monitoring**:
   - Check Service Health

### Running Tests

1. Navigate to the TestCloudWatch page in your application
2. Use the "Deploy Error Simulation" buttons to test specific error scenarios
3. Monitor the CloudWatch logs to verify proper error logging
4. Use "Check Service Health" to verify monitoring functionality

## Error Handling Flow

### Payment Service Timeout Flow

1. **Request Initiated**: Payment request sent with 5000ms timeout
2. **Timeout Detection**: If timeout occurs, error is classified as `payment_timeout`
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
4. **Circuit Breaker**: If failures exceed threshold, circuit breaker opens
5. **Logging**: Detailed error logging to CloudWatch with context
6. **User Feedback**: User-friendly error message returned

1. **Connection Request**: Database operation requests connection from pool
2. **Pool Check**: Verify available connections in pool
3. **Queue Management**: If pool exhausted, request is queued with timeout
4. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of pool health
5. **Alert Triggering**: Alerts triggered when utilization exceeds thresholds
6. **Recovery**: Automatic connection release and pool recovery

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Metrics

- **Service Response Times**: Monitor for performance degradation
- **Connection Pool Utilization**: Track database connection usage
- **Circuit Breaker Status**: Monitor service availability
- **Error Rates**: Track error frequency and patterns

### Alert Thresholds

- **Consecutive Failures**: 3 consecutive health check failures
- **Response Time Warning**: 5 seconds
- **Response Time Critical**: 10 seconds
- **Connection Pool Warning**: 80% utilization
- **Connection Pool Critical**: 95% utilization

## CloudWatch Integration

### Log Structure

```json
{
  "type": "payment_service_timeout",
  "service": "payment",
  "timeout": 5000,
  "transactionId": "txn_1234567890",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T19:17:25.304037+00:00",
  "context": {
    "originalError": "[ERROR] Payment service connection failed - timeout after 5000ms"
  }
}
```
