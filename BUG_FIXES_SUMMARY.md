# Bug Fixes and Deployment Improvements

## Summary
This document outlines the critical bugs and deployment issues that were identified and fixed in the ACM website codebase.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL SECURITY BUG** - Firebase Functions `removeAdmin` Function
**File:** `/functions/index.js` (Line 118)
**Issue:** The `removeAdmin` function was incorrectly setting `admin: true` instead of `admin: false` when removing admin privileges.
**Impact:** This would grant admin privileges instead of removing them, creating a serious security vulnerability.
**Fix:** Changed `{admin: true}` to `{admin: false}` in the `setCustomUserClaims` call.

### 2. **Timezone Inconsistency** - Event Date Formatting
**File:** `/functions/index.js` (Line 293)
**Issue:** Mixed timezone format usage - "America/Los Angeles" (with space) vs "America/Los_Angeles" (with underscore).
**Impact:** Could cause timezone parsing errors and incorrect event time displays.
**Fix:** Standardized all timezone references to use "America/Los_Angeles" (IANA format with underscore).

### 3. **ESLint Configuration Error** - Invalid Environment Setting
**File:** `/package.json` (Line 46)
**Issue:** Invalid ESLint environment "esnode22" was specified.
**Impact:** ESLint would fail to run properly, affecting code quality checks.
**Fix:** Changed "esnode22" to "es2022" which is the correct ECMAScript environment setting.

### 4. **Deprecated Dependency** - Request Library Usage
**File:** `/functions/index.js` and `/functions/package.json`
**Issue:** Using deprecated `request` library for HTTP requests to Discord webhooks.
**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities and maintenance issues due to unmaintained dependency.
**Fix:** 
- Replaced `request` library with native `fetch` API (available in Node.js 20)
- Updated Discord webhook calls to use modern fetch with proper error handling
- Removed `request` dependency from package.json

### 5. **CloudWatch Logger Robustness** - Error Handling Enhancement
**File:** `/src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js`
**Issue:** CloudWatch logger could fail application startup if AWS credentials were missing or invalid.
**Impact:** Application deployment failures when CloudWatch configuration is incomplete.
**Fix:** 
- Added configuration validation before initializing AWS SDK
- Implemented graceful fallback to console logging when CloudWatch is unavailable
- Enhanced error handling to prevent application crashes

## Technical Details

### Security Fix Details
The `removeAdmin` function bug was particularly critical because:
- It affected user permission management across the entire application
- Could allow unauthorized privilege escalation
- Would make it impossible to properly remove admin access

### Modernization Benefits
Replacing the `request` library with `fetch`:
- Eliminates security vulnerabilities from unmaintained dependencies
- Uses native Node.js functionality (no external dependencies)
- Provides better error handling and modern Promise-based API
- Reduces bundle size and improves performance

### Reliability Improvements
CloudWatch logger enhancements:
- Application now starts successfully even without AWS credentials
- Logging failures don't crash the application
- Clear console warnings when CloudWatch is unavailable
- Maintains logging functionality through console fallback

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Functions**: Test admin privilege addition and removal thoroughly
2. **Event Notifications**: Verify Discord webhook notifications work correctly
3. **Timezone Display**: Check event time formatting across different timezones
4. **Development Tools**: Ensure ESLint runs without errors
5. **Deployment**: Test deployment with and without CloudWatch configuration

## Deployment Notes

- Firebase functions will need to be redeployed to apply the security fix
- No breaking changes to existing APIs or user interfaces
- All changes are backward compatible
- CloudWatch logging will gracefully degrade if credentials are missing

## Risk Assessment

**Before Fixes:**
- HIGH: Critical security vulnerability in admin management
- MEDIUM: Potential timezone parsing errors
- MEDIUM: Development tool failures
- LOW: Dependency security risks

**After Fixes:**
- All identified risks have been mitigated
- Application is more robust and secure
- Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Modern, maintainable codebase

## Verification Steps

1. Deploy updated Firebase functions
2. Test admin user management (add/remove admin privileges)
3. Verify event notification system works
4. Check ESLint runs successfully in development
5. Confirm application starts with and without CloudWatch configuration
