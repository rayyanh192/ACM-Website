# Payment Timeout Incident Fix

## Incident Summary
**Time**: 2025-10-25T21:55:00.000Z  
**Issue**: High error rate (8.5%) and database connection pool exhaustion (95-98% utilization) after deployment that reduced payment timeout from 30s to 5s.

## Root Cause Analysis
The recent deployment (commit a1b2c3d) reduced payment gateway timeout from 30 seconds to 5 seconds for "faster failover". However, this timeout was too aggressive for payment processing, which typically takes 10-20 seconds to complete. This caused:

1. **Timeout Errors**: Legitimate payment requests timing out after 5s
2. **Retry Storms**: Failed payments triggering retries, overwhelming the system
3. **Database Pool Exhaustion**: Increased retry attempts exhausting the 20-connection pool
4. **Cascading Failures**: Timeout issues affecting multiple services (Python Lambda, Node.js, Java)

## Errors Fixed

### Before (Problematic State)
- Payment timeout: **5 seconds** (too aggressive)
- Database pool: **20 connections** with 5s acquire timeout
- Retry logic: Fixed 1s delays causing thundering herd
- No circuit breaker protection
- Poor error handling and monitoring

### After (Fixed State)
- Payment timeout: **20 seconds** (reasonable for payment processing)
- Database pool: **50 connections** with 15s acquire timeout
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff with jitter (2s base, 2x multiplier, 500ms jitter)
- Circuit breaker: 5 failure threshold, 60s recovery timeout
- Enhanced error handling and pool monitoring

## Files Modified

### 1. `config/timeout.json`
**Changes:**
- Increased payment timeout: 5000ms → 20000ms
- Enhanced database pool: 20 → 50 max connections, 5s → 15s acquire timeout
- Added exponential backoff configuration
- Added circuit breaker settings

### 2. `lib/payment_client.py`
**Changes:**
- Load timeout from config file instead of hardcoded 5s
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states)
- Added exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Better timeout error messages

### 3. `src/services/order-service.js`
**Changes:**
- Increased database connection pool size and timeouts
- Added connection pool health monitoring
- Enhanced error classification (timeout vs connection vs constraint errors)
- Added connection lifecycle logging
- Implemented health check endpoint

### 4. `com/checkout/payment/PaymentGateway.java`
**Changes:**
- Load timeout configuration from JSON file
- Increased HTTP timeout from 5s to 20s
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern
- Added exponential backoff with jitter
- Enhanced error handling and request timing
- Added health status monitoring

### 5. `src/payment_handler.py`
**Changes:**
- No changes needed - uses payment_client.py which was fixed
- Will benefit from improved timeout handling and circuit breaker

## Key Improvements

### 1. Timeout Optimization
- **Payment Gateway**: 5s → 20s (allows legitimate payments to complete)
- **Database Acquire**: 5s → 15s (reduces pool exhaustion)
- **Database Query**: 10s → 15s (handles complex queries better)

### 2. Connection Pool Scaling
- **Max Connections**: 20 → 50 (2.5x increase to handle load)
- **Min Connections**: 5 → 10 (better baseline capacity)
- **Acquire Timeout**: 5s → 15s (reduces "pool exhausted" errors)

### 3. Intelligent Retry Logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: 2s base × 2^attempt (prevents retry storms)
- **Jitter**: ±500ms randomization (prevents thundering herd)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fails fast when service is down

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring
- Connection pool utilization tracking
- Request timing and success/failure rates
- Circuit breaker state monitoring
- Detailed error classification

## Expected Impact

### Immediate Relief (Phase 1)
- ✅ Reduce timeout errors by ~80% (20s vs 5s allows most payments to complete)
- ✅ Decrease database pool exhaustion (50 connections vs 20)
- ✅ Lower error rate from 8.5% to <2%

### Stability Improvements (Phase 2)
- ✅ Prevent retry storms with exponential backoff
- ✅ Graceful degradation with circuit breakers
- ✅ Better error isolation between services

### Long-term Benefits (Phase 3)
- ✅ Proactive monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Faster incident detection and resolution
- ✅ Improved system resilience

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Configuration Update (Immediate)
1. Deploy updated `timeout.json` with increased timeouts
2. Monitor error rates and connection pool utilization
3. Verify payment success rates improve

### Phase 2: Code Deployment (Staged)
1. Deploy Python payment client with circuit breaker
2. Deploy Node.js order service with enhanced pool
3. Deploy Java payment gateway with improved retry logic
4. Monitor each deployment for stability

### Phase 3: Monitoring Enhancement
1. Set up alerts for timeout patterns
2. Implement dashboards for connection pool health
3. Add circuit breaker state monitoring

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. **Config Rollback**: Revert `timeout.json` to previous values
2. **Code Rollback**: Disable new retry logic, revert to simple fixed delays
3. **Pool Rollback**: Reduce connection pool to original size if DB performance degrades

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Payment timeout errors reduced significantly
- [ ] Database connection pool utilization <80%
- [ ] Error rate below 2%
- [ ] No performance degradation in database
- [ ] Circuit breakers functioning correctly
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational

## Lessons Learned
1. **Timeout Tuning**: Payment processing requires realistic timeouts (15-30s)
2. **Load Testing**: Timeout changes should be load tested before production
3. **Gradual Changes**: Reduce timeouts gradually, not from 30s to 5s at once
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Essential for preventing cascading failures
5. **Monitoring**: Proactive monitoring prevents incidents from escalating
