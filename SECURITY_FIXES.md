# Security Fixes and Critical Issue Resolution

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities and bugs that were identified and fixed in the ACM website codebase after deployment.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. üö® CRITICAL: AWS Credentials Exposed in Frontend (SECURITY VULNERABILITY)

**Issue**: AWS credentials were being used directly in the frontend code, exposing them in the client bundle.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js` - Direct AWS SDK usage
- `src/config/cloudwatch.js` - Environment variables for AWS credentials
- `package.json` - AWS SDK dependency in frontend

**Fix Applied**:
- Created secure Firebase function proxy (`functions/index.js` - `logToCloudWatch`)
- Moved AWS SDK usage to Firebase Functions backend
- Removed AWS credentials and SDK from frontend entirely
- Updated CloudWatch logger to use Firebase Functions proxy
- Deleted insecure config file

**Security Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ AWS credentials no longer exposed in client bundle
- ‚úÖ All CloudWatch logging now authenticated through Firebase
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and user authentication enforced

### 2. üêõ CRITICAL: Admin Privilege Bug (LOGIC ERROR)

**Issue**: `removeAdmin` function was incorrectly setting `admin: true` instead of removing admin privileges.

**File Affected**: `functions/index.js` - Line 118

**Fix Applied**:
- Corrected logic to properly remove admin claims
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Improved user feedback with success/error responses

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Admin privileges can now be properly removed
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental privilege escalation
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and logging

### 3. üîß Timezone Inconsistency (BUG FIX)

**Issue**: Mixed timezone formats in Firebase functions (`America/Los Angeles` vs `America/Los_Angeles`)

**File Affected**: `functions/index.js` - `formatDateTime` function

**Fix Applied**:
- Standardized all timezone references to use `America/Los_Angeles` (with underscore)
- Ensures consistent datetime formatting across all functions

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling (IMPROVEMENT)

**Issue**: Firebase functions lacked comprehensive error handling

**Files Affected**: `functions/index.js` - Multiple functions

**Improvements Applied**:
- Added try-catch blocks to all critical functions
- Improved input validation
- Added proper error logging
- Enhanced user feedback with detailed error messages
- Added duplicate role checking in `addRole`
- Added role existence validation in `removeRole`

## New Security Architecture

### CloudWatch Logging Flow (Before vs After)

**Before (Insecure)**:
```
Frontend ‚Üí AWS SDK ‚Üí CloudWatch
         ‚Üë (Credentials exposed)
```

**After (Secure)**:
```
Frontend ‚Üí Firebase Function ‚Üí AWS SDK ‚Üí CloudWatch
                ‚Üë (Credentials secure)
```

### Authentication Requirements
- All CloudWatch logging now requires user authentication
- Firebase Functions validate user permissions
- AWS credentials stored securely in Firebase environment

## Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables must be configured in Firebase Functions:

```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
LOG_GROUP_NAME=acm-website-logs
LOG_STREAM_NAME=error-stream
ACTIVITY_STREAM_NAME=activity-stream
```

## Testing

The `TestCloudWatch.vue` component has been preserved and will continue to work with the new secure architecture. All existing CloudWatch logging functionality is maintained while security is enhanced.

## Deployment Notes

1. **Firebase Functions**: Deploy updated functions with AWS SDK dependency
2. **Frontend**: Remove AWS SDK dependency and deploy updated CloudWatch logger
3. **Environment**: Configure AWS credentials in Firebase Functions environment
4. **Testing**: Verify CloudWatch logging functionality using test page

## Breaking Changes

- **None**: All existing CloudWatch logging calls continue to work
- The API remains the same, only the underlying implementation changed
- No changes required to existing components using CloudWatch logging

## Security Checklist

- ‚úÖ AWS credentials removed from frontend bundle
- ‚úÖ All logging authenticated through Firebase
- ‚úÖ Admin privilege bugs fixed
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Timezone consistency enforced
- ‚úÖ Input validation improved
- ‚úÖ Proper error logging added

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- CloudWatch logs for successful logging
- Firebase Functions logs for any errors
- Frontend console for fallback logging
- Admin operations for proper privilege management
