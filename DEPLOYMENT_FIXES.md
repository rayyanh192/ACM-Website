# Deployment Fixes and Configuration Guide

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase Functions - Admin Role Management Bug
**Issue**: The `removeAdmin` function was incorrectly setting `admin: true` instead of `admin: false`, causing it to grant admin privileges instead of removing them.

**Fix**: Updated `functions/index.js` line 118 to properly set `admin: false` when removing admin privileges.

**Impact**: This was a critical security issue that could have prevented proper admin role management.

### 2. CloudWatch Configuration Validation
**Issue**: CloudWatch logging was failing silently when environment variables were not configured, making it difficult to diagnose deployment issues.

**Fix**: 
- Added configuration validation in `src/config/cloudwatch.js`
- Implemented graceful degradation when CloudWatch credentials are missing
- Added clear warning messages for missing configuration
- Updated `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js` to handle missing configuration gracefully

**Impact**: Prevents silent failures and provides clear feedback about logging configuration issues.

### 3. Firebase Persistence Error Handling
**Issue**: `db.enablePersistence()` could cause application startup failures in certain environments (multiple tabs, unsupported browsers).

**Fix**: Added proper error handling around persistence enablement in `src/firebase.js` with specific error messages for different failure scenarios.

**Impact**: Ensures the application continues to work even when persistence cannot be enabled.

### 4. Timezone Format Inconsistency
**Issue**: Inconsistent timezone format in `formatDateTime` function - mixing "America/Los Angeles" (with space) and "America/Los_Angeles" (with underscore).

**Fix**: Standardized all timezone references to use "America/Los_Angeles" format in `functions/index.js`.

**Impact**: Prevents potential timezone parsing errors in event notifications.

### 5. Health Check Implementation
**Addition**: Added comprehensive health checking capabilities:
- Backend health check endpoint (`functions/index.js` - `healthCheck` function)
- Frontend health check component (`src/components/HealthCheck.vue`)
- Real-time status monitoring for all services

**Impact**: Provides visibility into application health and configuration status for easier troubleshooting.

## Required Environment Variables

For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# AWS CloudWatch Configuration (Required for logging)
VUE_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VUE_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
VUE_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

# CloudWatch Log Configuration (Optional - defaults provided)
VUE_APP_LOG_GROUP_NAME=acm-website-logs
VUE_APP_LOG_STREAM_NAME=error-stream
VUE_APP_ACTIVITY_STREAM_NAME=activity-stream
```

## Health Check Endpoints

### Backend Health Check
- **URL**: `https://your-project.cloudfunctions.net/healthCheck`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: JSON with service status information

### Frontend Health Check
- **Component**: `HealthCheck.vue`
- **Usage**: Import and use in admin pages or monitoring dashboards
- **Features**: Real-time status of Firebase, CloudWatch, and backend services

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables are set
- [ ] Test admin role management functions
- [ ] Verify CloudWatch log group exists in AWS
- [ ] Test Firebase functions deployment
- [ ] Run health check to verify all services

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Check browser console for configuration warnings
- [ ] Verify CloudWatch logs are being received
- [ ] Test admin role assignment/removal
- [ ] Verify Firebase persistence is working or gracefully degraded
- [ ] Test event notification formatting
- [ ] Access health check endpoint to verify backend status
- [ ] Use HealthCheck component to verify frontend status

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### CloudWatch Logging
- If CloudWatch credentials are missing, the application will log a warning and continue with console-only logging
- Check browser console for "CloudWatch configuration missing" warnings
- Verify log groups exist in AWS CloudWatch console

### Firebase Functions
- Admin role changes now properly remove privileges
- Event notifications use consistent timezone formatting
- Email sending includes proper error handling
- Health check endpoint provides service status

### Application Startup
- Firebase persistence failures are now handled gracefully
- Application will continue to work even if persistence cannot be enabled
- Check console for persistence-related warnings

### Health Monitoring
- Use the health check endpoint for automated monitoring
- Include HealthCheck component in admin dashboards
- Monitor service status in real-time

## Rollback Procedures

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Admin Function Issues**: Revert `functions/index.js` changes and redeploy functions
2. **CloudWatch Issues**: Set environment variables or revert configuration changes
3. **Firebase Issues**: Revert `src/firebase.js` changes if persistence causes problems
4. **Timezone Issues**: Revert `formatDateTime` function changes
5. **Health Check Issues**: Remove health check function if it causes problems

## Files Modified

1. `functions/index.js` - Fixed admin role bug, timezone consistency, added health check
2. `src/config/cloudwatch.js` - Added configuration validation
3. `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js` - Added graceful degradation
4. `src/firebase.js` - Added persistence error handling
5. `src/components/HealthCheck.vue` - New health monitoring component
6. `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` - This documentation file

## Future Improvements

1. Add automated configuration validation in CI/CD
2. Implement retry logic for CloudWatch logging
3. Add unit tests for admin role management functions
4. Expand health check to include more service dependencies
5. Add alerting based on health check results
6. Implement configuration management for different environments
