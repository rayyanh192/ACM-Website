# Deployment Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve deployment and runtime errors in the ACM website.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Firebase Function Bug
**File:** `functions/index.js`
**Issue:** The `removeAdmin` function was incorrectly setting `admin: true` instead of removing admin privileges.
**Fix:** Changed `{admin: true}` to `{admin: false}` on line 118.

### 2. Timezone Formatting Inconsistency
**File:** `functions/index.js`
**Issue:** Mixed timezone string formats ("America/Los Angeles" vs "America/Los_Angeles") causing potential parsing failures.
**Fix:** Standardized all timezone references to use "America/Los_Angeles" format.

### 3. CloudWatch Configuration Validation
**File:** `src/config/cloudwatch.js`
**Issue:** No validation for required environment variables, causing silent failures.
**Fix:** Added configuration validation with clear warning messages when credentials are missing.

### 4. Enhanced CloudWatch Error Handling
**File:** `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js`
**Issues:** 
- No fallback mechanism when CloudWatch is unavailable
- No retry logic for failed API calls
- Silent failures without proper logging
**Fixes:**
- Added fallback logging to console and localStorage
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added comprehensive error handling and status tracking
- Added utility functions for debugging and monitoring

### 5. Memory Leak Prevention
**File:** `src/main.js`
**Issue:** Global event listeners were added without cleanup mechanisms.
**Fix:** Implemented proper event listener management with cleanup functions.

### 6. Error Boundary Component
**File:** `src/components/ErrorBoundary.vue`
**Issue:** No component-level error handling for Vue components.
**Fix:** Created reusable error boundary component with CloudWatch integration.

### 7. Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging
**File:** `src/pages/TestCloudWatch.vue`
**Issue:** Limited visibility into system health and error patterns.
**Fix:** Enhanced test page with health checks, status monitoring, and debug information.

## Environment Variables Required

For CloudWatch logging to work properly, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
VUE_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VUE_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
VUE_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
VUE_APP_LOG_GROUP_NAME=acm-website-logs
VUE_APP_LOG_STREAM_NAME=error-stream
VUE_APP_ACTIVITY_STREAM_NAME=activity-stream
```

## Testing and Verification

### 1. CloudWatch Health Check
Visit `/test-cloudwatch` to:
- Test different error types
- Check CloudWatch connectivity
- View system status
- Access debug information

### 2. Admin Role Management
Test the fixed `removeAdmin` function:
1. Add admin role to a user
2. Remove admin role from the user
3. Verify the user no longer has admin privileges

### 3. Error Handling
- Check browser console for proper fallback logging when CloudWatch is unavailable
- Verify errors are stored in localStorage when CloudWatch fails
- Test component error boundaries by triggering component errors

## Deployment Notes

1. **Firebase Functions**: Deploy the updated functions with `firebase deploy --only functions`
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required CloudWatch environment variables are set in your deployment environment
3. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor the `/test-cloudwatch` page after deployment to verify system health
4. **Fallback Logging**: Check browser localStorage for `acm_error_logs` if CloudWatch logging fails

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Firebase Functions**: Revert to previous function deployment
2. **Frontend**: The new error handling is designed to be backward compatible
3. **CloudWatch**: If CloudWatch issues occur, the system will automatically fall back to console logging

## Monitoring

- Use the enhanced TestCloudWatch page for ongoing monitoring
- Check CloudWatch logs for error patterns
- Monitor localStorage for accumulated error logs
- Use the health check endpoint to verify system status

## Future Improvements

1. Implement log batching to reduce CloudWatch API calls
2. Add environment-based logging levels
3. Create automated health check alerts
4. Implement error aggregation and pattern detection
