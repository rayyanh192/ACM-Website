# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Critical Bug: Firebase Admin Role Management
**Issue**: The `removeAdmin` function in Firebase Functions was incorrectly setting `admin: true` instead of `admin: false` when removing admin privileges.

**Fix**: Updated `functions/index.js` line 118 to correctly set `admin: false`.

**Impact**: This bug could have caused serious security issues where attempting to remove admin privileges would actually grant them instead.

### 2. Code Duplication: CloudWatch Logger Files
**Issue**: Two identical CloudWatch logger files existed:
- `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js`
- `src/utils/cloudwatch-logger.js`

**Fix**: 
- Removed the duplicate `cloudwatch-logger.js` file
- Updated all imports in `ManageResume.vue` and `ProfilePage.vue` to use the consistent `cloudWatchLogger.js`

**Impact**: Eliminates confusion and potential conflicts during builds, ensures consistent logging behavior.

### 3. Timezone Inconsistency
**Issue**: Mixed timezone format usage in Firebase Functions:
- `"America/Los Angeles"` (with space) - incorrect
- `"America/Los_Angeles"` (with underscore) - correct

**Fix**: Standardized all timezone references to use `"America/Los_Angeles"` format in `functions/index.js`.

**Impact**: Ensures consistent date/time handling across all event scheduling and notifications.

### 4. Configuration Robustness: CloudWatch Setup
**Issue**: CloudWatch configuration lacked proper validation and fallback handling for missing environment variables.

**Fixes**:
- Enhanced `src/config/cloudwatch.js` with validation and development logging
- Updated `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js` to gracefully handle missing credentials
- Added fallback to console logging when CloudWatch is unavailable

**Impact**: Application now handles missing CloudWatch credentials gracefully without crashing, improving deployment reliability.

## Files Modified

1. `functions/index.js` - Fixed admin role removal bug and timezone consistency
2. `src/config/cloudwatch.js` - Added configuration validation and development logging
3. `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js` - Added graceful fallback handling
4. `src/components/ManageResume.vue` - Updated import path
5. `src/pages/ProfilePage.vue` - Updated import path
6. `src/utils/cloudwatch-logger.js` - **REMOVED** (duplicate file)

## Deployment Readiness

The application is now more robust and should handle deployment scenarios better:

✅ **Security**: Admin role management works correctly
✅ **Reliability**: CloudWatch logging fails gracefully if credentials are missing
✅ **Consistency**: All imports use standardized file paths
✅ **Accuracy**: Date/time operations use consistent timezone formatting

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Role Management**: Test admin removal functionality in Firebase console
2. **CloudWatch Logging**: Verify logging works in both development and production environments
3. **Date/Time Display**: Check that existing events display correctly with timezone fixes
4. **Error Handling**: Test application behavior when CloudWatch credentials are missing

## Environment Variables Required

For full CloudWatch functionality, ensure these environment variables are set:

```
VUE_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VUE_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
VUE_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
VUE_APP_LOG_GROUP_NAME=acm-website-logs
VUE_APP_LOG_STREAM_NAME=error-stream
VUE_APP_ACTIVITY_STREAM_NAME=activity-stream
```

If these are not set, the application will fall back to console logging without errors.
