# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed critical bugs and deployment issues identified in the codebase to prevent post-deployment errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug: removeAdmin Function (FIXED)
**File:** `/functions/index.js` (Line 118)
**Issue:** The `removeAdmin` function was incorrectly setting `admin: true` instead of removing admin privileges.
**Fix:** Changed `{admin: true}` to `{admin: false}` to properly remove admin privileges.

**Before:**
```javascript
return admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, {admin: true}).then(() => {
    return {message: "User removed as admin"};
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
return admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, {admin: false}).then(() => {
    return {message: "User removed as admin"};
});
```

### 2. CloudWatch Configuration Validation (FIXED)
**File:** `/src/config/cloudwatch.js`
**Issue:** No validation for required AWS credentials, causing potential runtime errors when environment variables are missing.
**Fix:** Added configuration validation and graceful degradation when CloudWatch is not properly configured.

**Changes:**
- Added `validateCloudWatchConfig()` function
- Added `isEnabled` flag to indicate if CloudWatch is properly configured
- Added warning message when AWS credentials are missing

### 3. CloudWatch Logger Error Handling (FIXED)
**Files:** 
- `/src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js`
- `/src/utils/cloudwatch-logger.js` (duplicate file with hyphen)

**Issue:** CloudWatch loggers would fail if AWS credentials were not configured, potentially breaking the application.
**Fix:** Added defensive programming to handle missing credentials gracefully.

**Changes:**
- Initialize CloudWatch Logs client only when properly configured
- Check for configuration before attempting to log
- Graceful fallback to console logging when CloudWatch is unavailable
- Added try-catch blocks around AWS SDK initialization

### 4. Potential Issues Identified (NOT FIXED - No Impact)
**File:** `/src/utils/logger.js`
**Issue:** This logger attempts to call a non-existent API endpoint `/api/log-error`.
**Status:** Not fixed as this logger doesn't appear to be actively used in the main application flow. The application primarily uses the CloudWatch loggers which have been fixed.

## Environment Variables Required
For full CloudWatch functionality, the following environment variables should be set:
- `VUE_APP_AWS_REGION` (defaults to 'us-east-1')
- `VUE_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (required for CloudWatch)
- `VUE_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (required for CloudWatch)
- `VUE_APP_LOG_GROUP_NAME` (defaults to 'acm-website-logs')
- `VUE_APP_LOG_STREAM_NAME` (defaults to 'error-stream')
- `VUE_APP_ACTIVITY_STREAM_NAME` (defaults to 'activity-stream')

## Deployment Impact
These fixes ensure that:
1. Admin role management works correctly
2. The application deploys successfully even without CloudWatch credentials
3. Logging failures don't crash the application
4. All existing functionality remains intact

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test admin role removal functionality
2. Deploy with and without CloudWatch environment variables
3. Verify that logging failures don't affect user experience
4. Test all existing CloudWatch logging functionality when properly configured
