# Deployment Fixes - Payment and Database Connection Issues

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the critical errors that occurred after the recent deployment:

1. **Payment service connection failed - timeout after 5000ms**
2. **HTTPSConnectionPool timeout in payment processing**
3. **Database query failed: connection pool exhausted**

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Payment Service Timeout Issues

**Problem**: Payment processing was failing due to connection timeouts and lack of proper retry mechanisms.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive payment processing system with:
- Configurable timeout settings (5000ms default)
- Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts)
- Circuit breaker pattern for service resilience
- Proper error logging and monitoring

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/payment_handler.js` (new)
- `src/utils/cloudWatchLogger.js` (enhanced)
- `src/config/cloudwatch.js` (enhanced)

### 2. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Problem**: Database queries were failing due to connection pool exhaustion and lack of connection management.

**Solution**: Implemented database connection pool manager with:
- Connection pooling with configurable limits (10 max connections)
- Connection timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Automatic connection cleanup and idle connection management
- Query retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pool monitoring and statistics

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/database_config.js` (new)
- `functions/index.js` (updated existing functions)

### 3. HTTPS Connection Pool Timeout

**Problem**: External API calls were experiencing connection pool timeouts.

**Solution**: Implemented centralized connection pool management with:
- HTTP/HTTPS connection pooling with keep-alive
- Configurable socket limits and timeouts
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Health check monitoring
- Connection pool statistics and monitoring

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/connection_pool.js` (new)
- `functions/package.json` (added axios dependency)

## New Features

```javascript
// Example usage
const paymentHandler = new PaymentHandler();
const result = await paymentHandler.processPayment(25.99, 'credit_card', 'txn_123');
```

**Features**:
- Timeout handling (5000ms configurable)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

}, 'getUserData');
```

**Features**:
- Connection pooling (10 max connections)
- Query timeout handling (10 seconds)
- Automatic connection cleanup
- Pool status monitoring

### 3. Connection Pool Manager

```javascript
// Example usage
const client = connectionPoolManager.createHttpClient('payment-service', 'https://api.payment.com');
const response = await connectionPoolManager.makeRequest('payment-service', { method: 'POST', url: '/charge' });
```

**Features**:
- HTTP/HTTPS connection pooling
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Health check monitoring
- Connection statistics

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables for optimal configuration:

```bash
# CloudWatch Configuration
VUE_APP_CLOUDWATCH_TIMEOUT=10000
VUE_APP_CLOUDWATCH_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
VUE_APP_CLOUDWATCH_RETRY_DELAY=1000

# Connection Pool Settings
VUE_APP_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
VUE_APP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000

# Payment Service Settings
VUE_APP_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT=30000
VUE_APP_PAYMENT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL=https://api.payment-service.com
PAYMENT_API_KEY=your_payment_api_key

# Database Settings
VUE_APP_DATABASE_TIMEOUT=10000
VUE_APP_DATABASE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# Monitoring Settings
VUE_APP_ENABLE_METRICS=true
VUE_APP_METRICS_INTERVAL=60000
```

## New Firebase Functions

### 1. processPayment
Handles payment processing with timeout and retry logic.

```javascript
// Call from frontend
const processPayment = httpsCallable(functions, 'processPayment');
const result = await processPayment({ amount: 25.99, paymentMethod: 'credit_card' });
```

### 2. getDatabasePoolStatus
Returns current database connection pool status.

```javascript
// Call from frontend (admin only)
const getPoolStatus = httpsCallable(functions, 'getDatabasePoolStatus');
const status = await getPoolStatus();
```

### 3. getConnectionPoolStats
Returns HTTP connection pool statistics.

```javascript
// Call from frontend (admin only)
const getStats = httpsCallable(functions, 'getConnectionPoolStats');
const stats = await getStats();
```

### 4. resetCircuitBreakers
Resets circuit breakers for service recovery.

```javascript
// Call from frontend (admin only)
const resetBreakers = httpsCallable(functions, 'resetCircuitBreakers');
await resetBreakers({ serviceName: 'payment-service' }); // or omit for all services
```

- Connection pool timeout tracking
- Transaction failure recovery
- Detailed error context logging

### Database Errors
- Connection pool exhaustion detection
- Query timeout handling
- Automatic retry with backoff

## Deployment Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Configure the environment variables listed above in your deployment environment.

3. **Deploy Firebase Functions**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Test payment processing functionality
   - Check connection pool status
   - Monitor CloudWatch logs for errors

## Monitoring Dashboard

Access the test interface at `/test-cloudwatch` to:
- Test payment processing
- Check connection pool status
- Monitor error logging
- Verify timeout handling

## Error Recovery

### Automatic Recovery
- Circuit breakers automatically reset after timeout period
- Connection pools self-manage and cleanup idle connections
- Retry logic handles transient failures

### Manual Recovery
- Use `resetCircuitBreakers` function to manually reset failed services
- Monitor connection pool status and manually restart if needed
- Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error analysis

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Timeout Errors**: Proper timeout configuration and retry logic
2. **Better Resource Management**: Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
3. **Improved Reliability**: Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed logging and metrics for better observability

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-scaling**: Implement dynamic connection pool sizing based on load
2. **Advanced Metrics**: Add more detailed performance metrics
3. **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive service health monitoring
4. **Load Balancing**: Add load balancing for multiple service instances

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment Timeouts**: Check `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` and `PAYMENT_API_KEY` configuration
2. **Database Pool Exhaustion**: Monitor pool status and adjust `VUE_APP_MAX_CONNECTIONS`
3. **Circuit Breaker Activation**: Use `resetCircuitBreakers` function or wait for automatic reset
4. **CloudWatch Logging Failures**: Verify AWS credentials and permissions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Firebase function logs
firebase functions:log

# Test connection pool status
curl -X POST https://your-project.cloudfunctions.net/getConnectionPoolStats

# Monitor CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/your-function-name --follow
```

## Conclusion

These fixes address the critical timeout and connection pool issues by implementing:
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Proper connection pool management
- Circuit breaker patterns for service resilience
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging

The system is now more resilient to network issues, service outages, and high load conditions.
