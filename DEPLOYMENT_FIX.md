# Deployment Fix: Payment Timeout and Database Connection Issues

## Issue Summary

**Deployment SHA**: `a1b2c3d`  
**Deployment Time**: 2025-10-25T21:45:00Z  
**Issue**: Reduced payment timeout from 30s to 5s caused widespread failures

### Observed Problems
1. **Payment Timeouts**: 8.5% error rate due to 5s timeout being too aggressive
2. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**: 95-98% utilization causing connection failures
3. **Payment Gateway Unreachable**: Connection reset and timeout errors
4. **Cascade Failures**: Max retries exceeded across multiple services

## Root Cause Analysis

The deployment reduced payment service timeout from 30s to 5s for "faster failover", but this timeout was too aggressive for the payment processing workflow, causing:

- Payment requests to timeout before completion
- Increased retry attempts overwhelming the database connection pool
- Cascade failures across dependent services
- Connection pool exhaustion preventing new database connections

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Configuration Changes (`config/timeout.json`)
```json
{
  "payment_service": {
    "timeout_ms": 30000,        // Restored from 5000ms
    "retry_attempts": 3,
    "retry_delay_ms": 1000,
    "connection_timeout_ms": 10000
  },
  "database": {
    "connection_timeout_ms": 30000,
    "pool_timeout_ms": 60000,
    "max_connections": 20,      // Increased pool size
    "min_connections": 5
  },
  "api": {
    "request_timeout_ms": 25000,
    "keepalive_timeout_ms": 5000
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Payment Handler (`src/payment_handler.py`)
- **Proper timeout handling**: Uses 30s timeout with exponential backoff
- **Retry logic**: 3 attempts with increasing delays
- **Error categorization**: Distinguishes timeout vs connection errors
- **Structured logging**: Detailed error tracking for monitoring

### 3. Improved Payment Client (`lib/payment_client.py`)
- **HTTP session management**: Connection pooling and keep-alive
- **Timeout configuration**: Separate connection and request timeouts
- **Retry strategy**: Built-in retry for transient failures
- **Health checks**: Service availability monitoring

### 4. Database Connection Management (`src/services/order-service.js`)
- **Connection pooling**: Proper pool sizing (5-20 connections)
- **Timeout handling**: 30s connection timeout, 60s idle timeout
- **Pool monitoring**: Connection statistics and health checks
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry and connection cleanup

### 5. Java Payment Gateway (`com/checkout/payment/PaymentGateway.java`)
- **Consistent timeouts**: 30s request timeout matching other services
- **Retry mechanism**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Connection management**: HTTP/2 client with proper timeouts
- **Health monitoring**: Service availability checks

## Key Improvements

### Timeout Strategy
- **Payment Service**: 30s (restored from 5s)
- **Database Connections**: 30s connection, 60s idle
- **API Requests**: 25s overall timeout
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 1.5s, 2.25s)

### Connection Pool Management
- **Max Connections**: 20 (increased from default)
- **Min Connections**: 5 (maintain warm pool)
- **Pool Timeout**: 60s (prevent indefinite waiting)
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time pool statistics

### Error Handling
- **Timeout Errors**: Proper categorization and retry logic
- **Connection Errors**: Automatic recovery and circuit breaking
- **Structured Logging**: Correlation IDs and detailed error context
- **Health Checks**: Service availability monitoring

## Deployment Validation

### Pre-Deployment Checks
1. Validate configuration file syntax
2. Ensure environment variables are set
3. Test database connectivity
4. Verify payment service availability

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. **Error Rate**: Should drop below 1% within 5 minutes
2. **Database Pool**: Utilization should stay below 80%
3. **Payment Latency**: P95 should be under 10s
4. **Connection Health**: No connection timeout errors

### Rollback Plan
If issues persist:
1. Revert `config/timeout.json` to previous values
2. Restart all affected services
3. Monitor error rates for 10 minutes
4. If still failing, perform full deployment rollback

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Payment Service
PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL=https://api.payment-service.internal
PAYMENT_API_KEY=your_payment_api_key

# Database
DB_HOST=checkout-db-prod.cluster-xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=checkout_db
DB_USER=checkout_user
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password

# Monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## Testing Commands

### Configuration Validation
```bash
# Validate JSON syntax
python -m json.tool config/timeout.json

# Test Python payment handler
python -c "from src.payment_handler import PaymentHandler; h = PaymentHandler(); print('Config loaded successfully')"

# Test Node.js order service
node -e "const OrderService = require('./src/services/order-service.js'); const os = new OrderService(); console.log('Service initialized successfully');"
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Database connection test
node -e "const os = require('./src/services/order-service.js'); new os().healthCheck().then(console.log);"

# Payment service health
python -c "from lib.payment_client import PaymentClient; pc = PaymentClient({}); print(pc.health_check())"
```

## Monitoring Alerts

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Error rate > 5%
- Database pool utilization > 90%

- **Database Pool Utilization**: < 80%
- **Payment Success Rate**: > 99%
- **Average Response Time**: < 5s
- **P95 Response Time**: < 10s

## Files Changed

1. `config/timeout.json` - Timeout configuration
2. `src/payment_handler.py` - Python Lambda payment processor
3. `lib/payment_client.py` - HTTP client library
4. `src/services/order-service.js` - Node.js database service
5. `com/checkout/payment/PaymentGateway.java` - Java payment gateway

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Apply configuration and code changes
2. **Monitor Metrics**: Watch error rates and connection pools
3. **Validate Health**: Run health checks on all services
4. **Load Testing**: Verify system handles expected traffic
5. **Documentation**: Update runbooks with new timeout values
