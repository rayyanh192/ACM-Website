# [HOTFIX] Fix payment timeout and database connection pool exhaustion

## 🚨 Critical Issue Resolution

**Deployment SHA**: `a1b2c3d`  
**Issue**: Payment timeout reduced from 30s to 5s causing 8.5% error rate and database connection pool exhaustion

## 📊 Impact

- **Error Rate**: 8.5% (25 errors in recent deployment)
- **Database Pool**: 95-98% utilization causing connection failures
- **Services Affected**: Payment processing, order creation, checkout API
- **Customer Impact**: Failed payments and order processing

## 🔧 Root Cause

The recent deployment reduced payment service timeout from 30s to 5s for "faster failover", but this timeout was too aggressive for the payment processing workflow, causing:

1. Payment requests timing out before completion
2. Increased retry attempts overwhelming database connection pool
3. Cascade failures across dependent services

## ✅ Solution

### Configuration Changes
- **Payment Timeout**: Restored from 5s to 30s
- **Database Pool**: Increased max connections from default to 20
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Connection Management**: Added proper pooling and keep-alive

### Files Added/Modified

1. **`config/timeout.json`** - Centralized timeout configuration
   - Payment service: 30s timeout, 3 retries
   - Database: 20 max connections, 30s timeout
   - API: 25s request timeout

2. **`src/payment_handler.py`** - Python Lambda payment processor
   - Proper timeout handling with exponential backoff
   - Structured error logging and categorization
   - Health check endpoints

3. **`lib/payment_client.py`** - HTTP client library
   - Connection pooling and keep-alive
   - Retry strategy for transient failures
   - Timeout configuration management

4. **`src/services/order-service.js`** - Node.js database service
   - PostgreSQL connection pooling (5-20 connections)
   - Connection health monitoring
   - Automatic retry and cleanup

5. **`com/checkout/payment/PaymentGateway.java`** - Java payment gateway
   - HTTP/2 client with proper timeouts
   - Circuit breaker pattern implementation
   - Consistent retry logic across services

## 🧪 Testing

### Validation Script
```bash
python validate_fix.py
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test configuration loading
python -c "from src.payment_handler import PaymentHandler; print('✅ Payment handler loads config')"

# Test database connection
node -e "const OrderService = require('./src/services/order-service.js'); console.log('✅ Order service initializes')"
```

## 📈 Expected Results

### Immediate (within 5 minutes)
- Error rate drops below 1%
- Database pool utilization below 80%
- Payment processing success rate > 99%

### Long-term Monitoring
- P95 response time < 10s
- No connection pool exhaustion events
- 99.9% payment success rate

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

1. **Deploy Configuration**: Apply timeout.json changes
2. **Deploy Services**: Update payment handler, order service, payment gateway
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Watch error rates and connection pools for 10 minutes
4. **Validate Health**: Run health checks on all services

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert `config/timeout.json` to previous values
2. Restart affected services
3. Monitor for 10 minutes
4. Full deployment rollback if needed

## 📊 Monitoring

### Critical Alerts
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Database pool utilization < 80%
- [ ] Payment service response time < 10s

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Payment timeout errors eliminated
- [ ] Database connection stability restored
- [ ] End-to-end request processing within SLA

## 🔍 Review Checklist

- [ ] Configuration values are reasonable and tested
- [ ] All services can load configuration successfully
- [ ] Database connection pooling is properly configured
- [ ] Retry logic prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Health checks validate service availability
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are configured
- [ ] Rollback plan is documented and tested
