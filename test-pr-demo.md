# Test PR Demo

This file demonstrates changes made for the test PR.

## Changes Made

1. **Homepage Update**: Added "[Test PR - Draft]" indicator to the main subtitle on the homepage
2. **Console Logging**: Added a console log message when the IndexHome component mounts
3. **Documentation**: Created this demo file to document the test changes

## Purpose

This is a test PR to demonstrate the pull request process. These changes are:
- Non-breaking
- Easily reversible
- Clearly marked as test changes
- Functional but minimal

## Verification

To verify these changes:
1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit the homepage and look for "[Test PR - Draft]" in the subtitle
3. Open browser developer tools and check console for the mount message
4. Confirm this documentation file exists in the project root

## Cleanup

When this test PR is complete, these changes should be reverted:
- Remove the "[Test PR - Draft]" text from the homepage
- Remove the console.log statement
- Delete this documentation file
