# Pull Request: [HOTFIX] Fix navigation button typo causing 91.7% failure rate on home page

## ðŸš¨ Critical Production Issue - Immediate Fix Required

### Incident Summary
- **Incident Time**: 2025-10-26T14:30:00.000Z
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - 91.7% navigation button failure rate
- **Impact**: 45% increase in bounce rate, 73 navigation failures in 3 minutes
- **Affected Component**: Home page navigation buttons (Club Info, Events, Resources)

### Root Cause Analysis
A typo was introduced in commit `d68ca82` that broke all navigation buttons on the home page:
- **File**: `src/pages/IndexHome.vue`, line 48
- **Issue**: Method call `scrolTo(link.to)` should be `scrollTo(link.to)`
- **Method Definition**: The correct method `scrollTo(refName)` exists on line 393
- **Impact**: All three "Learn more" navigation buttons became non-functional

### Error Details from CloudWatch Logs
```
HomePageInteractionFailureRate: 91.7% (threshold: 75%)
JavaScriptErrorSpike: 300% increase in runtime errors
Error Message: "TypeError: this.scrolTo is not a function"
Affected Buttons: Club Info, Events, Resources
```

### Fix Applied
**Single line change in `src/pages/IndexHome.vue`:**
```diff
- @click="scrolTo(link.to)"
+ @click="scrollTo(link.to)"
```

### Verification Completed
âœ… No other instances of "scrolTo" typo found in codebase  
âœ… Method signature matches: `scrollTo(refName)` exists and is correct  
âœ… Fix maintains Vue.js event handling compatibility  
âœ… No breaking changes or additional dependencies required  

### Expected Outcomes
- **Immediate**: Navigation buttons will function correctly
- **Short-term**: HomePageInteractionFailureRate drops below 75%
- **Medium-term**: Bounce rate returns to baseline
- **Long-term**: Restored user navigation experience

### Testing Recommendations
1. Manual test all three navigation buttons (Club Info, Events, Resources)
2. Verify smooth scrolling to respective sections
3. Monitor CloudWatch alarms post-deployment
4. Check bounce rate recovery in analytics

### Deployment Priority
**HOTFIX** - This should be fast-tracked through review and deployed immediately to restore critical home page functionality.
