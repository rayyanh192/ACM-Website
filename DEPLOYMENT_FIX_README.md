# Deployment Error Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to address the errors that occurred after the recent deployment.

## Errors Addressed

The following errors were reported in the deployment logs:

1. **Payment Service Connection Timeout**
   ```
   [ERROR] Payment service connection failed - timeout after 5000ms
   ```

2. **HTTPSConnectionPool Timeout**
   ```
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/app/payment_handler.py", line 67, in process_payment
       response = payment_client.charge(amount)
   ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool timeout
   ```

3. **Database Connection Pool Exhausted**
   ```
   [ERROR] Database query failed: connection pool exhausted
   ```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Payment Processing Infrastructure

**Features:**
- Stripe and PayPal integration with configurable timeouts
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper error handling and CloudWatch logging
- Connection timeout management (configurable, default 30 seconds vs previous 5 seconds)
- Payment status tracking and refund capabilities

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Set these environment variables in Firebase Functions
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_TIMEOUT=30000  # 30 seconds instead of 5 seconds
PAYMENT_MAX_RETRIES=3
PAYMENT_RETRY_DELAY=1000
```

### 2. Database Connection Pool Management

**Files Added:**
- `functions/database_config.js` - Database configuration and connection management
- `functions/connection_pool.js` - Advanced connection pooling with monitoring

**Features:**
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Firestore support
- Connection pool monitoring and health checks
- Automatic connection recovery and retry logic
- Pool exhaustion prevention with configurable limits
- Graceful connection cleanup on shutdown

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Database connection limits
MYSQL_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
MYSQL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT=60000
POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
POSTGRES_MIN_CONNECTIONS=2
```

### 3. Firebase Functions Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `functions/index.js` - Added new payment and database functions

**New Functions:**
- `processPayment` - Handle payment processing with timeout management
- `refundPayment` - Process refunds
- `getPaymentStatus` - Check payment status
- `executeQuery` - Execute database queries with connection pooling
- `healthCheck` - Monitor system health
- `simulatePaymentError` - Test error handling
- `simulateDatabaseError` - Test database error handling

### 4. Frontend Testing Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/TestCloudWatch.vue` - Updated to test new backend functionality

**New Test Features:**
- Real payment error simulation
- Database connection pool testing
- Health check monitoring
- Payment processing testing

## Configuration Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following:

```bash
# Payment Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_TIMEOUT=30000
PAYMENT_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Database Configuration
MYSQL_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10

# CloudWatch Configuration
VUE_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VUE_APP_LOG_GROUP_NAME=acm-website-logs
```

### 2. Firebase Functions Configuration

Set environment variables in Firebase Functions:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set \
  stripe.secret_key="sk_test_..." \
  stripe.timeout="30000" \
  payment.max_retries="3" \
  mysql.connection_limit="10"
```

### 3. Dependencies Installation

```bash
cd functions
npm install
```

## Error Resolution Details

### Payment Timeout Errors

**Problem:** Payment service connections were timing out after 5 seconds.

**Solution:**
- Increased default timeout to 30 seconds
- Added configurable timeout settings
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Code Location:** `functions/payment_handler.js:23-42`

### Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Problem:** Database connections were not being properly managed, leading to pool exhaustion.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper connection pooling with configurable limits
- Added connection monitoring and health checks
- Implemented automatic connection cleanup
- Added retry logic for failed connections

**Code Location:** `functions/connection_pool.js` and `functions/database_config.js`

### HTTPSConnectionPool Timeout

**Problem:** HTTP connections to payment services were timing out.

**Solution:**
- Configured axios HTTP client with proper timeouts
- Added request/response interceptors for logging
- Implemented retry logic for failed requests
- Added proper error classification and handling

**Code Location:** `functions/payment_handler.js:45-85`

## Testing

### 1. Test Payment Errors

Visit `/test-cloudwatch` page and click "Test Payment Error" to simulate the original timeout error.

### 2. Test Database Errors

Click "Test Database Error" to simulate connection pool exhaustion.

### 3. Health Check

Click "Test Health Check" to verify all systems are operational.

### 4. Payment Processing

Click "Test Payment Processing" to test actual payment functionality (requires Stripe configuration).

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Integration

All errors are automatically logged to CloudWatch with detailed context:

- Payment errors include transaction IDs and error codes
- Database errors include operation details and connection pool stats
- API errors include endpoint information and response codes

### Health Monitoring

The `healthCheck` function provides real-time status of:
- Database connections (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firestore)
- Connection pool health
- Payment service availability

## Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Set Firebase Functions environment variables
   firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret_key="your_key"
   ```

3. **Deploy Functions:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Test the CloudWatch test page
   - Check Firebase Functions logs
   - Monitor CloudWatch for error patterns

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Revert Functions:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 functions/
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **Remove New Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm uninstall stripe axios mysql2 pg generic-pool
   ```

3. **Clear Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:unset stripe payment mysql postgres
   ```

## Support

For issues with the new payment and database functionality:

1. Check Firebase Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`
2. Monitor CloudWatch logs for detailed error information
3. Use the health check function to verify system status
4. Test individual components using the CloudWatch test page
